# Interview Project: Full-Stack Intern (Chrome Extension Development with Plasmo Framework)

Task 1: Backend API Development for Word Translations
Develop a backend API that the Chrome extension can communicate with to fetch translations.
The API should have endpoints to:
1. Retrieve translations for a given word and target language.
2. Add new translations to the database.
3. Update existing translations.
4. Delete translations.
Requirements:
● 1. The API should support at least three languages for translation.
● 2. Implement proper error handling and validation.
● 3. Ensure the API responses follow RESTful design principles.
● 4. Include appropriate API documentation.

Task 2: Basic Chrome Extension Development
Develop a basic Chrome extension using the Plasmo Framework that interacts with the backend
API developed in Task 1. The extension doesn't need a sophisticated UI but should be able to:
1. Capture a word selected by the user.
2. Communicate with the backend API to fetch the translation.
3. Display the translation to the user.

Requirements:
● 1. Use the Plasmo Framework for the implementation.
● 2. Implement basic error handling.
