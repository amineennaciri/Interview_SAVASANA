# Interview Project: Full-Stack Intern (Chrome Extension Development with Plasmo Framework)

Task 1: Backend API Development for Word Translations
Develop a backend API that the Chrome extension can communicate with to fetch translations.
The API should have endpoints to:
1. Retrieve translations for a given word and target language.
2. Add new translations to the database.
3. Update existing translations.
4. Delete translations.
Requirements:
● 1. The API should support at least three languages for translation.
● 2. Implement proper error handling and validation.
● 3. Ensure the API responses follow RESTful design principles.
● 4. Include appropriate API documentation.
